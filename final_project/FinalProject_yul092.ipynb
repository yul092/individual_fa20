    "This prrject studies the effect of past inspections and violations to future scores and violations in food facilities in North Carolina. The Food Branch of the Food and Drug Protection Division of North Carolina conduct routine health inspections on food facilieties. I want to find out if these inspections could stimulate businesses to improve their quality of food and reduce potential healh-related risks. This study covers three major types of food facilities:  like restaurants, food stands, and public school lunchrooms. "

    "Food Regulatory Specialists of the Food Branch of the Food and Drug Protection Division of NC performs are in charge of routinely inspected food faciliteis without prior anouncement to ensure the credibility and sanitation of food and food producing, storing, and distributing process. According to the Food and Agriculture Organizaiont of the United States, food inspections have shifted the main focus from reaction to prevention. This means that wether food inspections results affect the performance in future inspections is crucial and a criterion to judge the effectiveness of the system of inspection. \n",

    "According to a research conducted by Sarah E. Leinwand in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2013-2014, based on wether or not the restaurants are chained, the frequency of food inspections by the public health departments in Philadelphia ] reduce violations. The reduce is more significant in restaurants that have most violations. Thus, increasing the number of inspections conducted each year would result in preventing or reducing future violations. This research categorized restaurants into chained and non-chained and found no difference between the results of two. \n",

    "Health inspections do not stimulate food facilites to perform well in future inspections in North Carolina. The concern is that the majority of customers wouldn't check the health inspections records before dining in those food facilities. Many restaurants are shown to have a huge amount of critical and noncritical violations even if they were inspected many times. Thus, health inspections might not perform effectiveness in stimulating restaurants to improve. "
